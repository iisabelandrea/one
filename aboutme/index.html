      <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a current third year undergraduate student, I transfered to IIT this semester
            from College of DuPage. I started at college of DuPage right after high school in 2012
            for a whole four years taking classes that would help me figure out my path and get
            to where I am today. At IIT I plan to enroll in the Co-Terminal program to
            receive my bachelors in ITM and a masters in Cyber Forensics and Security.
            I’ve been a part time nanny for a family for over a year,
            and I starting working as the assistant student admin in the ITM office.
            Hobbies: I like to try and stay active, I don’t like playing sports but I
            do love to swim and was a swimmer for 12 years. Oddly enough I love being around
            babies and hanging out with kids. I used to teach
            swim lessons for them starting as young as 6 months old!! This page is more of a
            personal page and will upload more features as I advance in the course.
